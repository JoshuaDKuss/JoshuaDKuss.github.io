				<h3>I've always worn many hats</h3>
				<p>I'm a family man, obsessed with music, mechanically inclined, who loves fixing and learning new things on my own. 
          I've driven nearly 500,000 miles in my professions, bringing various services to over 10,000 people in the Twin Cities area, while operating my own LLC's.
          In that time, I've also been a part of 5 different music groups (church worship teams and rock bands).</p>
